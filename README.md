# Mandelbrot Explorer

This repository provides a small Python script to interactively explore the Mandelbrot set using Matplotlib.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

Run the script with:

```bash
python mandelbrot_zoom.py
```

An interactive window will open. Drag with the left mouse button to draw a rectangle and zoom in on that region of the Mandelbrot set.
You can also use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out around the cursor
position and drag with the right mouse button to pan around the current view.
